# Project Goals Outline


* Outline
    * Goal of the project
        * Provide a coworking and meeting space for the EA and AIS clubs at UCLA
    * Specific actions or steps our project involves
        * Identify and sign lease for apartment costing around 4k/month
        * Maintain space for duration of 12 months
        * Host around 1 retreat a month between EA and AIS combined
    * What impact will this have on the world?
        * We expect the grant to have a positive impact in the following two ways
        * Saving money
            * AIS and EA @ UCLA combined run about 1 retreat a month on average, in addition to other social events
            * We currently host these at the X-Lab. If we didn't have the X-Lab, we would have to rent an airbnb for these. This would cost approximately 2k per event, in addition to approx 10 hours of collective organizer time to find, rent, and move supplies back and forth.
        * Providing Coworking space
            * We believe having a coworking space increases the proportion of time members spend on AI Safety and EA related tasks.
            * Enables us to have meetings on short notice, and thereby increases the number of meetings. This increases engagement.
    * What are the risks of this project?
        * Based on our experience with the X-Lab, the main risk is low utilization. Fewer people than we expected regularly co-worked at the x-lab. The main reason for this was that it's distance was inconvenient.
    * How will we know if we've been successful
        * This is one of our uncertainties, we're not sure how to determine what the counterfactual where we don't have a dedicated space looks like.
        * We will consider it a success if the space receives high utilization.
        * We will monitor usage of the space in order to determine utilization
            * Electronic Sign In

What is your project’s goal, how will you know if you’ve achieved it, and what is the path to impact?

Our project is to provide a coworking and meeting space for the EA and AIS clubs at UCLA. We will identify and sign a lease for an apartment costing around 4k/month. We will maintain the space for the duration of 12 months. We will host around 1 retreat a month between EA and AIS combined. We expect the grant to have a positive impact by saving money and providing a coworking space.

We currently host both retreats and social events at the X-Lab. If we didn't have the X-Lab, we would have to rent an Airbnb in order to run them, costing approximately 2k per event. In addition, we estimate that approximately 10 hours of collective organizer time would be utilized in the process of finding, renting, and moving supplies back and forth. In addition to retreats, we also use the space for other social events. Having a dedicates space saves time. For non-overnight social events only, we estimate that we collectively save about 5 hours of organizer time. To summarize, we expect the grant to save us about $2000 of rent, and 15 hours of organizer time ($450 at $30/hr).

Secondarily, we believe having a coworking space would be beneficial to the EA and AIS communities. Having a coworking space increases the proportion of time members spend on AI Safety and EA related tasks. We already have office supplies such as standing desks, monitors, and whiteboards from the X-Lab, which we will bring to the new space. We will also provide a printer and snacks. Based on conversations with current AIS and EA club members, we think that having a coworking space has increased engagement through the following two mechanisms:
1. Since we don't need to book rooms in advance, we've increased the number of short-notice in person meetings.
2. Members meet other members by hanging around in the X-Lab, and thereby build relationships.

However, we have uncertainties about the impact of the grant. We're not sure how to determine what the counterfactual where we don't have a dedicated space looks like, and thus, we can't tell how impactful the grant will be. We can try looking at clubs at other colleges that don't have their own dedicated space, but are in our reference class with respect to other factors. That being said, for the purposes of this grant, we will consider it a success if the space receives high utilization, and members believe that the space has increased engagement.
