## Nouns

There are several classes of nouns that are gramatically relevant. 
In the hopes of keeping a relatively small grammar, we'll assign nouns one or more of the following properties:
* Animacy:
    * Whether or not the noun can be referred to with "who" rather than "which"
* Proper:
    * eg "John", "Taj Mahal"
* Mass:
    * eg "water". These nouns can be used without determiners. If you try to count them, you need to use a classifier like "a drop of" before referring to them.
* Countable:
    * These nouns behave "normally". "one stick", "two sticks" 

## Verbs
Verbs are even more complex. Our grammar that we'll define is largely a cover grammar.
Nearley's error detection is not user-friendly, so being able to be generous with accepting ambiguous parses,
and then ruling them out later will allow us to provide better error messages.

For now, we'll be using a simplified version of the frames described here: https://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/vn/reference.php

Verbs may be assigned one or more of the following:
* Intransitive (V)
* Intransitive w predicate (V PredComp)
*
