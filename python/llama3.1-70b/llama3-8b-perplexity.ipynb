      " Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : 杜甫 ; 712 – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty. Along with Li Bai ( Li Po ), he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets. His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant, but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations. His life, like the whole country, was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755, and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers, his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture. Of his poetic writing, nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages. He has been called the \" Poet @-@ Historian \" and the \" Poet @-@ Sage \" by Chinese critics, while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as \" the Chinese Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Shakespeare, Milton, Burns, Wordsworth, Béranger, Hugo or Baudelaire \". \n",

      " Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Burton Watson attributes to \" the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality \". Since many of Du Fu's poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers, \" The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether \". Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the \" reductive \" categorizations used for more limited poets. \n",

      " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Du Fu's mother died shortly after he was born, and he was partially raised by his aunt. He had an elder brother, who died young. He also had three half brothers and one half sister, to whom he frequently refers in his poems, although he never mentions his stepmother. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " The son of a minor scholar @-@ official, his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and memorisation of the Confucian classics of philosophy, history and poetry. He later claimed to have produced creditable poems by his early teens, but these have been lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In the early 730s, he travelled in the Jiangsu / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem, describing a poetry contest, is thought to date from the end of this period, around 735. In that year, he took the civil service exam, likely in Chang 'an. He failed, to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " His father died around 740. Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father's rank, but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers. He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area, fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In the autumn of 744, he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time, and the two poets formed a friendship. David Young describes this as \" the most significant formative element in Du Fu's artistic development \" because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam. The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided, however. Du Fu was by some years the younger, while Li Bai was already a poetic star. We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet, but only one in the other direction. They met again only once, in 745. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In 746, he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career. He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year, but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ). He never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755. He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 755. From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ), the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In 755, he received an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant's office of the Crown Prince's Palace. Although this was a minor post, in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career. Even before he had begun work, however, the position was swept away by events. \n",

      " The An Lushan Rebellion began in December 755, and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years. It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 recorded 52 @.@ 9 million people, but ten years later, the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million, the remainder having been displaced or killed. During this time, Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars, associated famines and imperial displeasure. This period of unhappiness was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that, \" What he saw around him — the lives of his family, neighbors, and strangers – what he heard, and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry \". Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child, he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own misfortunes. Du Fu wrote : \n",
      "\n",

In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu ( Baby Bear ), was born. Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria. \n",

      " He escaped from Chang 'an the following year, and was appointed Reminder when he rejoined the court in May 757. This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial. Du Fu's conscientiousness compelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge. He was arrested but was pardoned in June. He was granted leave to visit his family in September, but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8, 757, he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces. However, his advice continued to be unappreciated, and in the summer of 758 he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Huazhou. The position was not to his taste : in one poem, he wrote : \n",

      "\n",
      " I am about to scream madly in the office / Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk. \n",
      "\n",

      " He moved on in the summer of 759 ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine, but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason. He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou ( now Tianshui, Gansu province ), where he wrote more than sixty poems. \n",

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Many of Du's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at \" thatched hut \". In 762, he left the city to escape a rebellion, but he returned in summer 764 when he was appointed an advisor to Yan, who was involved in campaigns against the Tibetan Empire. \n",

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.

      " Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing, but during filming Rossen made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats. \n",

      " The Hustler is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said : \" My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game. \" Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing The Hustler as \" one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams. \" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " The film was also somewhat autobiographical for Rossen, relating to his dealings with the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee. A screenwriter during the 1930s and'40s, he had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first HUAC appearance. Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members. Similarly, Felson sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character. \n",

      " Film and theatre historian Ethan Mordden has identified The Hustler as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re @-@ defined the relationship of films to their audiences. This new relationship, he writes, is \" one of challenge rather than flattery, of doubt rather than certainty. \" No film of the 1950s, Mordden asserts, \" took such a brutal, clear look at the ego @-@ affirmation of the one @-@ on @-@ one contest, at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerability of the loser. \" Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir, Mordden rejects the comparison based on Rossen's ultra @-@ realistic style, also noting that the film lacks noir's \" Treacherous Woman or its relish in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie, hungry bank clerks and lusty wives. \" Mordden does note that while Fast Eddie \" has a slight fifties ring \", the character \" makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the'rebel'era... [ b ] ut he does end up seeking out his emotions \" and telling Bert that he is a loser because he's dead inside. \n",

      " The Hustler had its world premiere in Washington, D.C. on September 25, 1961. Prior to the premiere, Richard Burton hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season's Broadway shows, which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth. Initially reluctant to publicize the film, 20th Century Fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities. \n",

      " The film was well received by critics, although with the occasional caveat. Variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the \" sordid aspects \" of the story prevented the film from achieving the \" goal of being pure entertainment. \" Variety also felt the film was far too long. Stanley Kauffmann, writing for The New Republic, concurred in part with this assessment. Kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast, calling Newman \" first @-@ rate \" and writing that Scott's was \" his most credible performance to date. \" Laurie, he writes, gives her part \" movingly anguished touches \" ( although he also mildly criticizes her for over @-@ reliance on Method acting ). While he found that the script \" strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall \" and also declares it \" full of pseudo @-@ meaning \", Kauffmann lauds Rossen's \" sure, economical \" direction, especially in regard to Gleason who, he says, does not so much act as \" [ pose ] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by Rossen. It is the best use of a manikin by a director since Kazan photographed Burl Ives as Big Daddy. \" The New York Times, despite finding that the film \" strays a bit \" and that the romance between Newman and Laurie's characters \" seems a mite far @-@ fetched \", nonetheless found that The Hustler \" speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths. \" \n",

      " In the decades since its release, The Hustler has cemented its reputation as a classic. Roger Ebert, echoing earlier praise for the performances, direction, and cinematography and adding laurels for editor Dede Allen, cites the film as \" one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories. \" He further cites Fast Eddie Felson as one of \" only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones. \" TV Guide calls the film a \" dark stunner \" offering \" a grim world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table, yet [ with ] characters [ who ] maintain a shabby nobility and grace. \" The four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as \" not to be missed. \" \n",

      " Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie Felson in the 1986 film The Color of Money, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. A number of observers and critics have suggested that this Oscar was in belated recognition for his performance in The Hustler. In 1997, the Library of Congress selected The Hustler for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. \" Carroll and Rossen's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America in 2006 as the 96th best motion picture screenplay of all time. In June 2008, AFI released its \" Ten top Ten \" — the best ten films in ten \" classic \" American film genres — after polling over 1 @,@ 500 people from the creative community. The Hustler was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre. \n",

      " The Hustler is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States, which had been on the decline for decades. The film also brought recognition to Willie Mosconi, who, despite having won multiple world championships, was virtually unknown to the general public. Perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the film's popularity was a real @-@ life pool hustler named Rudolf Wanderone. Mosconi claimed in an interview at the time of the film's release that the character of Minnesota Fats was based on Wanderone, who at the time was known as \" New York Fatty \". Wanderone immediately adopted the Minnesota Fats nickname and parlayed his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures. Author Walter Tevis denied for the rest of his life that Wanderone had played any role in the creation of the character. Other players would claim, with greater or lesser degrees of credibility, to have served as models for Fast Eddie, including Ronnie Allen, Ed Taylor, Ed Parker, and Eddie Pelkey. \n",
